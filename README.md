# WebScraping_MercadoLivre

Using BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to pull housing data from Mercado Livre's website. 
My goal was to get information on Price, Location, Total Area and Type (House, Apartment etc.).

Please note that some columns of the created data frame are labeled in Portuguese.
